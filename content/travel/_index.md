## Address

Seebad Enge,
Mythenquai 9,
8002 Zürich,
Switzerland

## By train or tram

We recommend coming to our wedding by public transport - one our favorite aspects of Switzerland! Zürich's public transport is frequent, reliable, and well-connected, with regular services even during the night.

<br>

The train station "Bahnhof Enge" is about a 10-minute walk from the destination and is a good choice
when arriving by train. Bahnhof Enge is just one stop from Zürich's central station, "Zürich HB," which connects to a wide range of destinations, including areas where you might find better hotel prices.

<br>

Trams are another great way to reach the venue. Both the "Rentenanstalt" and "Bürkliplatz" tram stops are within a short walk of the destination. Zürich’s tram network is extensive, with most hotels and major sights conveniently located near tram stops.

<br>

If you’re planning to join the afterparty at "Paddy Reilly's," note that it’s about a 10-minute walk from Zürich central station. From there, public transport will run throughout the night to all major locations.

## By taxi
If you prefer to travel by taxi, we recommend using Uber, as it’s relatively affordable and operates late into the night.

## By car
We do not recommend driving to the venue due to limited parking options.
