## By train

We recommend coming to our wedding by public transport, one our favorite aspects of Zürich!
The train station "Bahnhof Enge" is about a ten minute walk from the destination and is a good choice
when coming by train. Bahnhof Enge is a single stop away from the Zürich central station, or "Zürich HB", which is very well connected to a variety of locations (where you may find better hotel prices).

However, you should also consider coming by tram instead.
Both the tram stations "Rentenanstalt" and "Bürkliplatz" are within a short walk of the destination, and the tram network is well connected within Zürich.

Notice that if you join the afterparty, we will move to "Paddy Reilly's", which in turn is about a ten minute walk to Zürich central station. Public transport will run throughout the night to all major locations from there.

## By taxi
If you do wish to come by Taxi, we recommend taking an Uber, as they are somewhat reasonably priced and run until late into the night.

## By car
We do not recommend coming by car.
