It is your presence, not your present, that is important to us on our special day. Simply having you here, especially if you’ve traveled to celebrate with us, is more than we could ever ask for. However, if you’d like to give a gift, we would gratefully accept a small contribution toward our honeymoon or helping us settle into our new home.
