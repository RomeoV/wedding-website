title: "Dress Code"
---

We recommend festive attire, such as a suit, dress, jumpsuit, or chinos paired with a button-down shirt - whatever makes you feel glamorous, confident, and comfortable! The most important thing is that you feel good in what you wear. Merel and Romeo will be wearing a classic white wedding dress and suit, respectively.

Please be aware that the wedding will be held in a semi-outdoor setting! The dining area will be enclosed by three walls and a roof (not visible in the photo), while the terrace overlooking the water will remain uncovered. We will provide heat lamps and blankets if needed, depending on the weather. We nevertheless recommend bringing extra layers for the evening chill.

<br>

Also note that the venue has **wooden floorboards with ~0.5cm gaps**! We kindly suggest choosing footwear accordingly - perhaps saving your stiletto heels for another occasion.
