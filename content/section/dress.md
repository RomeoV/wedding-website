The wedding will be semi-outdoors! We will have three walls, a roof (not shown on the pictures), heating lamps and blankets as necessary. However, you may still want to bring extra layers for the later hours.
Also, the wedding will happen **on wooden floor tiles with ~0.5cm gaps**! Please choose your shoes accordingly. I.e., you may want to leave your stiletto heels for another day.
