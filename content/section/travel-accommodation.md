Here are the take-home messages:

<br>

The "Badi" – as Seebad Enge is affectionately called – is easily accessible by public transport from anywhere in or around Zürich.
Simply take a train to "Bahnhof Enge" and walk the last meters to the venue! Alternatively, the nearest tram stop, "Rentenanstalt," is also within walking distance.

<br>

Parking near the venue is limited, and overnight parking is not permitted.
