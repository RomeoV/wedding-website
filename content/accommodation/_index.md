We do not provide or recommend any specific hotel, and it is up to you to find a nice location to stay.
We are aware that Zürich is an expensive city, and so are the hotel prices.
However, the public transport within Zürich is very well connected, even late into the night, and so we recommend some areas to stay.

## An isochrone map of Zürich
When booking accommodation, we recommend first considering [this "isochrone" map](https://commutetimemap.com/map?places=47.361700%253B8.536701%253B0%253B900%253B%25234143f4&places=47.361700%253B8.536701%253B0%253B1800%253B%2523fc0000) to get a feeling for commute times for a given location.
Red marks the area reachable within 30 minutes by public transport from the venue.
