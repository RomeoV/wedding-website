We do not provide accommodation for guests or endorse specific hotels, so it’s up to you to choose a location that suits your needs. We recognize that Zürich is an expensive city, including for accommodation. However, thanks to Zürich’s well-connected public transport system, which operates even late at night, it’s not necessary to stay in the city center to be within easy reach of the venue.

## An isochrone map of Zürich
When you book your accommodation, consider [this "isochrone" map](https://commutetimemap.com/map?places=47.361700%253B8.536701%253B0%253B900%253B%25234143f4&places=47.361700%253B8.536701%253B0%253B1800%253B%2523fc0000) of Zürich, which highlights areas with a short commute to the wedding venue. The red zone marks areas reachable within 30 minutes by public transport from the "Badi" (Seebad Enge).
